<h1>C++ Cross-Process Shared Memory Tools<a class="headerlink" href="#c-cross-process-shared-memory-tools" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The C++ Cross-Process Shared Memory Tools is new In PicklingTools 1.4.0.</p>
<p>Although the PicklingTools library has had tools to handle cross
process shared memory for sometime (since 1.0.0), this release
introduces some simple abstractions to help make using shared memory
a little bit easier.</p>
<div class="section" id="reminder">
<h2>Reminder<a class="headerlink" href="#reminder" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>First, a quick reminder: C++ Vals <em>can</em> be used with shared memory:
this is the reason the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Allocator</span></tt> became an inherent part of
the PicklingTools back in 1.0.0.  For example, to create a Tab in
some shared memory region:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>char* mem = ... create/attach shared memory across processes ...
StreamingPool *shm=StreamingPool::CreateStreamingPool(mem, bytes, 8);
Val v = Shared(shm, Tab());
v["a"] = "hello";   // Table and keys and values in shared memory</pre>
</div>
<p>The shared memory can be created with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SHMCreate</span></tt> or connected to
with already created memory with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SHMAttach</span></tt>, but it&#8217;s tricky to get
this right with the basic tools provided by the simple abstractions in
&#8220;sharedmemory.h&#8221;:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>size_t bytes = 1024*1024;
char* mem = SHMCreate("shm_region", bytes);
// Created, but is it available yet?  Do you have to check
// if the entire shared memory has been mapped into the process
// with SHMInitialized, etc.</pre>
</div>
<p>The process for using shared memory is a little clumsy:  Who creates and
who attaches?
The creator is responsible for calling <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SHMInitialize</span></tt> and the user
is responsible for called <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SHMInitialized</span></tt> to see if the region
is ready, even it already mapped it.  But these have to done in the right
order, and it&#8217;s not well documented.</p>
<p>To address these concerns, there are three new abstractions that handle
Vals in shared memory a little better.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="shmmain-serverside-and-clientside">
<h2>SHMMain, ServerSide and ClientSide<a class="headerlink" href="#shmmain-serverside-and-clientside" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are three new classes that make using shared memory a lot easier:
SHMMain, ServerSide and ClientSide.    These all come from:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c">#include &quot;shmboot.h&quot;   // Gets defn of SHMMain, ClientSide and ServerSide</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="shmmain">
<h3>SHMMain<a class="headerlink" href="#shmmain" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>SHMMain is responsible for creating the shared memory region of the proper
size that all ServerSide and ClientSides can use.  And that&#8217;s it.
It needs to be called exactly once.</p>
<p>Ideally, the SHMMain gets called exactly once in a startup process
that gets called before everyone else: frequently at the start of some
main process that has to be started before anything else in the app:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>#include "shmboot.h"

int main (int argc, char**argv)
{
   int bytes = atoi(argv[1]);

   // Initial set-up code
   bool debug = true;
   SHMMain mem("shm_region", bytes, debug);
   mem.start();  // Actually calls and creates region

   ... start rest of application, fork processes, etc. ...

}</pre>
</div>
<p>Sometimes, if an application is built piecewise, the model described
above won&#8217;t quite  work:  imagine something similar to a UNIX
pipeline where each process may be communicating piecewise
to server and a client.  In a case like that, the &#8220;head&#8221; of the
pipeline would be where the SHMMain should have to be created.</p>
<p>Once the SHMMain is created (and started), this establishes
a shared memory zone or &#8220;pool&#8221; where queues and Vals can be used.
Note that the SHMMain can be created from any process, even
if there are no servers or clients in it: its sole purpose is
to create and establish the shared memory region that later
ServerSides and ClientSides use.</p>
<p>Expert Notes: If you are creating a system where the
clients and servers all are all created from one
main process, then that makes things easier: you don&#8217;t
<em>have</em> to specify a region, as all clients/servers
that inherit from the main process can use the region already
mapped in the main process: assuming all clients/servers <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fork</span></tt>
from the main above and don&#8217;t <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">exec</span></tt>, the shared memory set-up
from SHMMain will be inherited (in a process sense, not in a
OOP sense) and be in the same address space in all the clients.
However, if (like all the examples in the baseline), the
clients and servers are completely separate processes, they
HAVE to be mapped to the same area: in this case, you want
to specify where in memory to map:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>// On a 32-bit i386 Linux machine, force into a pretty unused area
SHMMain mem("shm_region_32bit", bytes, debug, (void*)0xB0000000);

// On a 64-bit x86_64 Linux machine, force into pretty unused area
SHMMain mem("shm_region_64bit", bytes, debug, (void*)0x700000000000ULL);</pre>
</div>
<p>Although the small standalone programs tend to work without
forcing to use a particular region, larger &#8220;real&#8221; applications
tend to need to be forced.  Although the ServerSide and ClientSide
<em>can</em> explicitly set the memory needed, usually you only
want to do this in the SHMMain (which sets it up in the
right region) and that forces all clients and servers to
attach to the right region.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="serverside">
<h3>ServerSide<a class="headerlink" href="#serverside" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The ServerSide presents the abstraction of a server, although strictly
speaking it can also be either side of a communication.  The most
important thing a ServerSide does is to create the pipe (in shared memory)
which will be used for queuing and enqueueing.</p>
<p>To create a pipe, you have to give it a string name (in the example below,
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pipename</span></tt>) and start the ServerSide:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>// Create a pipe in the shared memory region (string name used in SHMMain)
// The pipe has the given capacity (capacity is in packets).
bool debug = true;
int packet_capacity = 4;
ServerSide server("shm_region",
                  "pipename", packet_capacity. true);

server.start();   // pipe only created when started
CQ&amp; pipe = server.pipe();</pre>
</div>
<p>Once the pipe has been created, it can be enqueued or dequeued
from: <em>Note that queueing and dequeueing is thread-safe</em>: I.e.,
you can have multiple processes operating on the queue simultaneously
and its state is never inconsistent.   Typically, the ServerSide
enqueues and the ClientSide dequeues from the given CQ:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>// ServerSide enqueues
for (int seq=0; ; seq++) {

   // Create the value to enqueue in shared memory
   Val data = Shared(server.pool(), Tab());  // Create a Tab in shared memory
   data["sequence_number"] = seq;

   // Now enqueue
   bool enqueued = false;
   real_8 timeout_in_seconds = 3.2;
   while (!enqueued) {
       enqueued = pipe.enqueue(data, timeout_in_seconds);
       if (!enqueued) {
           cerr &lt;&lt; "Failed to enqueue after " &lt;&lt; timeout_in_seconds
                &lt;&lt; " in seconds ... trying again ..." &lt;&lt; endl;
       } else {
           cout &lt;&lt; "Enqueued! Going to next packet" &lt;&lt; endl;
           break;
       }
   }

}</pre>
</div>
<p>Note that the enqueue has a timeout: in case the queue is full
and the Val can&#8217;t be placed in the queue, it will wait up to
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">timeout_in_seconds</span></tt> for some space to open up.  If the space
opens up in the given time, the data is enqueued and enqueue returns true:
the data has now been enqueued.
If space doesn&#8217;t open up in the given time, enqueue returns
false.  In the example code above, the sender just keeps retrying,
but gives a warning every 3.2 seconds warning indicating the queue is full.</p>
<p>Although typically the ServerSide is used as the <em>send</em> side only,
there&#8217;s no reason the ServerSide can&#8217;t dequeue as well (see below
for examples of how to dequeue).  This ability might be useul if that queue
needed to be cleaned as part of a shutdown or restart.</p>
<p>There is another call to enqueue data <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pipe.enq(data)</span></tt> which will
block forever; this is simpler and will work but makes it harder
to detect error conditions and/or gracefully exit.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="clientside">
<h3>ClientSide<a class="headerlink" href="#clientside" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The ClientSide is the other end of the pipe: if the ServerSide creates
the pipe and writes to it, then the ClientSide waits for the pipe to be
created so it can attach and read from the pipe:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre> ClientSide client("shm_region", "pipename", true);
 client.start(); // blocks waiting for pipe to be created

 CQ&amp; pipe = client.pipe();

 // Once pipe is available, we can read from it
 real_8 timeout_in_seconds = 5.5;
 while (1) {

   // Try to dequeue a single packet
   Val packet;
   bool valid=false;
   while (!valid) {

       valid = pipe.dequeue(timeout_in_seconds, packet);
       if (!valid) {
             cerr &lt;&lt; "Couldn't dequeue after " &lt;&lt; timeout_in_seconds
                  &lt;&lt; " ... trying to dequeue again ... " &lt;&lt; endl;
             continue;
       } else {
             cout &lt;&lt; "Got packet!" &lt;&lt; endl;
             break;
       }

   }
}</pre>
</div>
<p>Note that the client (in order to read from the proper pipe) has to match
<em>both</em> the name of the shared memory region <em>and</em> the pipename the server
writes to.</p>
<p>In the above example, if the client can&#8217;t get something from
the pipe immediately, thee queue blocks for up to a few seconds.
If something appears on the pipe before the timeout, then that value
is dequeued and taken off the pipe and valid becomes true.  If after
those few seconds the pipe is still empty, valid becomes false and the
dequeue fails.</p>
<p>This is basic paradigm: Use SHMMain to create the shared memory region
before anything else starts, start and create a sender with a ServerSide
and client with ClientSide.</p>
<p>Note that the ClientSide and ServerSide will block until SHMMain
is called and creates the memory pool.  The ClientSide will block
and wait until the the ServerSide creates the pipe.  The only way this
can become problematic if the shared memory pool has a &#8220;unclean&#8221; shutdown:
if you can&#8217;t guarantee SHMMain is called before all the clients
and servers are created, it&#8217;s important to make sure the shared memory
region has been destroyed, otherwise the client and server may
pick up the shared pool from the LAST invocation.  To make sure the
shared memory is clean, make sure /proc/shm does has been cleaned
up and does NOT contain the memory pools; this is discussed a bit more
in the <em>Five Major Headaches</em> section below later.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="middleside">
<h3>Middleside<a class="headerlink" href="#middleside" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Many times a server is also a client: it reads from one queue
and posts to another queue (like a UNIX pipeline): this role is
frequently called a <em>transformer</em> in X-Midas or M2k speak.  The example below
show how to <em>both</em> read from a client and post to a server
in the same process:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>ClientSide client("shm_region", "pipe_0", true);
client.start(); // read from this pipe
CQ&amp; input = client.pipe();

ServerSide server("shm_region", "pipe_1", 4, true);
server.start(); // write to this pipe
CQ&amp; output = server.pipe();

while (1) {

    // Read from input pipe
    Val in_packet;
    if (!input.dequeue(.1, in_packet))
        continue; // retry to get input

    // Write to output pipe
    bool enqueued = false;
    while (!enqueued) {
      enqueued = out.enqueue(in_packet, .1);
    }
}</pre>
</div>
<p>In this way, a client and server can be used together.  In fact, there
is no apriori limit on the number of clients and servers that can be in
a single process (limited only by the amount of memory).  Multiple clients
and/or servers allows programming any type of semantics you want:
see the new section.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="complex-interactions">
<h2>Complex Interactions<a class="headerlink" href="#complex-interactions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>By default, the CQ class (so-called because it is a Queue that
preserves thread-safety using a Condition variable: CQ) has a simple
interface: Vals (which exist in shared memory, this is critical!)
can either be enqueued or dequeued.  Period.  There can be any number
of processes enqueueing or dequeueing simultaneously,
but (this is important) <em>there is
no notion of multicast</em>: once a Val is dequeued by any reader, it&#8217;s gone,
even if there are twelve readers.   If we wanted to support multicast,
or any complicated semantics for multiple readers, we have to enforce
those ourselves.</p>
<p>For example, if we wanted to have the multicast semantics to
only dequeue when all the readers have read the packet (or anything
more complicated), we could put all the logic in a simple component
with one input and multiple outputs:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>// Implement a simple multicast with n clients where
// all clients see all data that is dequeued.

// Start up the single input
ClientSide single_input("shm_region", "pipe_input", true);
single_input.start();
CQ&amp; input = single_input.pipe();

// Array of outputs: each output queue will see the input exactly once
Array&lt;ServerSide*&gt; outputs;
for (int ii=0; ii&lt;number_of_outputs; ii++) {
   ServerSide* ssp=new ServerSide("shm_region", "out"+Stringize(ii), 4, true);
   ssp-&gt;start();
   outputs.append(ssp);
}

while (1) {

   // Pull input off the input queue
   Val in_packet;
   if (!input.dequeue(.1, in_packet)) {
      continue;  // nothing available, try again
   }

   // Got input: implement multicast semantics so
   // all outputs see the same input
   for (int ii=0; ii&lt;outputs.length(); ii++) {
      ServerSide* ssp = outputs[ii];
      CQ&amp; out = ssp-&gt;pipe();

      // Try to enqueue; blocks until delivered
      out.enq(in_packet);
   }
}</pre>
</div>
<p>With the example above, all outputs see a copy of the input.
Since <em>hopefully</em> the input packet is just a proxy (where the
underlying Tab is shared), this should be a quick and easy
dispersal.</p>
<p>Although this abstraction makes it a little harder to implement
multiple readers and writers, it gives you full mechanism to
implement any policy for multiple readers.
For example, in the example above, the multicast can get stuck if one
the readers never reads its pipe: the enqueue blocks forever.
What if we
wanted data to drop if the reader hadn&#8217;t read it after 5 seconds?:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>bool enqueued = out.enqueue(in_packet, 5.0);
if (!enqueued) {
   cerr &lt;&lt; "Reader " &lt;&lt; ii " &lt;&lt; is too slow, dropping packet" &lt;&lt; endl;
   continue;
}</pre>
</div>
<p>Thus with a simple change,
we have implemented a custom multi-cast semantics.   For systems where
dropped data is okay, we can implement whatever semantics we need
with whatever time constraints are relevant.  If dropped data is not
okay, we can keep retrying to send data, with some messages.
We could also implement a nice GUI to show the status of a pipe.
Whatever is needed can be built on ServerSide, ClientSide and timeouts.</p>
<div class="section" id="address-randomization">
<h3>Address Randomization<a class="headerlink" href="#address-randomization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Many Linuxes today implement the Address Randomization &#8220;feature&#8221;
to stop hackers from exploiting address space regularity.  In other words,
the code and data part of your program can be randomly place
&#8220;anywhere&#8221; in main memory.
This can be problematic for systems where shared memory needs to
be mapped in: What if regions conflict?
What part of memory is used? To that end, you may
have to force your processes to turn off this feature.  This
feature can be turned off on a per-process basis easily:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>% setarch i386 -L -R serverside_ex ...    # 32-bit machine
       or
% setarch x86_64 -L -R serverside_ex ...  # 64-bit machine</pre>
</div>
<p>Frequently, the simple examples work without the above, but the
more complex programs may need to do the above.  Note that the
examples remind you to use setarch when you run them.</p>
<p>If you forget to turn off the feature, then each of the SHMMain,
ClientSide and ServerSide will <em>warn</em> you with a large message
to standard error:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>% serverside_ex ...   # forgot to run with setarch!

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WARNING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
! It appears that the address randomization feature is still on.
! Your SHMMain/ServerSide/ClientSide is unlikely to work correctly.
! Program will continue running ... but may not run correctly ...
!
! Make sure the process that's gets started up has this feature
! turned off using setarch.  For example:
!  % setarch i386 -L -R startup_program     # 32-bit machine
!           or
!  % setarch x86_64 -L -R startup_program   # 64-bit machine
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</pre>
</div>
<p>Detecting the absence of the Address Randomization feature
is a bit tricky, so you may be using setarch correctly but it still outputs
the warning.  Lots of false positive warning messages are clumsy
and messy, so there is a mechanism to turn off the potential
warning.  For example, to turn off this
message for SHMMain:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>SHMMain mem(...);
mem.warning(false);  // Turn off warning message above
mem.start();         // Warning message above suppressed</pre>
</div>
<p>Both ClientSide and ServerSide have the same method.  By default,
the warning is turned on: the idea is that it is better to get a
warning message when you are first starting so you can figure
out how things work; Once you are comfortable and always
turning on the setarch feature, you don&#8217;t need the warning
anymore and can turn it off if needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="examples">
<h3>Examples<a class="headerlink" href="#examples" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are three standalone examples and three X-Midas examples
in the PicklingTools baseline demonstrating the shared mem client/server tools.</p>
<p>In the C++ area are serverside_ex.cc, middleside_ex.cc and clientside_ex.cc
examples.  These three examples should be run together <em>on the same machine</em>:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre># In one shell prompt
% setarch i386 -L -R serverside_ex mempool 1000000 pipe1 4</pre>
</div>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">serverside_ex</span></tt> creates the shared memory region (called <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mempool</span></tt>)
of one million bytes.  The pipe the server will write to is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pipe1</span></tt>
and it will have a capacity of four packets:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre># In another shell prompt
% setarch i386 -L -R middleside_ex mempool pipe1 pipe2 4</pre>
</div>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">middleside_ex</span></tt> waits for the shared memory region (called <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mempool</span></tt>)
to be available.  Once it is, the middleside reads from <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pipe1</span></tt> and
writes to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pipe2</span></tt>; <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pipe2</span></tt> also has a capacity of four packets:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre># In yet another shell prompt
% setarch i386 -L -R clientside_ex mempool pipe2</pre>
</div>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">clientside_ex</span></tt> waits for the memory pool, waits from <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pipe2</span></tt> to
be created, then reads
from <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pipe2</span></tt>.</p>
<p>This will cause the server to talk the middle and the middle will talk
to the final client.  Note that SHMMain is created <em>exactly once</em>
by serverside_ex.</p>
<p>Also note that the X-Midas primitives can talk to the standalone
executables.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="five-biggest-headaches">
<h3>Five Biggest Headaches<a class="headerlink" href="#five-biggest-headaches" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The five biggest problems getting shared memory across platforms to work are:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Memory size:  Most Linuxes are constrained by how much
shared memory they can allocate.  If the allocation is too
big, then Linux will simply fail.  Carefully try larger
and larger sizes of shared memory from SHMMain to make
sure that your box can legally create and use that much shared memory.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Using Vals in shared memory.  Once a Val is created
in shared memory, most updates on the table will cause the
new keys/values to be created in the same shared memory.
If you wish to enqueue a table or Array, make <em>sure</em> the
entire table is in shared memory:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>// Okay
Val data = Shared(shm, Tab());  // created in shared memory
pipe.enqueue(data);             // Okay, because data in shared memory

// !!!! NOT OKAY!!!
Val data2 = Tab();  // data2 NOT in shared memory!!
pipe.enqueue(data2);  // Will seg fault</pre>
</div>
<p>There is a routine called <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">IsSHM</span></tt> from #include &#8220;checkshm.h&#8221;
which allows the user to check and see if a Val is completely contained
in shared memory.  In debug mode, this is a very useful
tool; before data is enqueued on a shared memory pipe, the table
can be checked to make sure all of its parts are in shared memory.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Left-Over files.  By default, the shared memory regions have an
file in the /dev/shm area.  There is good news and bad news
about this.  If you do not destruct SHMMain (in the C++ sense),
then the region persists.  This can be good because your queues can persist
across time: assuming a client connect and disconnects frequently,
this can just work as the new connection will simply pick up where the
last one left off.</p>
<p>This can be horrible if the queues get into an inconsistent state:
then every client will simply break.</p>
<p>It can be useful to completely clean /dev/shm of your
shared memory.  By default, when you create shared memory region
like the &#8220;shm_region&#8221; in all the examples above, two files are created:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>/dev/shm/shm_region_boot
/dev/shm/shm_region</pre>
</div>
<p>The boot region is very small and used only to pass global information
to each client (where memory should be mapped, the size of the memory,
where to find the pipes, etc).  The boot is first mapped in anywhere
in memory.  The data in the boot informs where to map
the main section: the main section contains the giant memory pool.</p>
<p>To make sure your application starts in a fresh start, it&#8217;s probably
worth removing <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/dev/shm/shm_region_boot</span></tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/dev/shm/shm_region</span></tt> before starting, or restarting your application.
Note that <em>by default</em>,
SHMMain will completely clean-up for you when you create and start
the SHMMain component.</p>

<li><p class="first">Forgetting About Address Randomization</p>
<p>Frustratingly, sometimes things will work with the address
randomization on, then one small change will cause everything
to stop working.  It&#8217;s best put this as part of a start-up script
where all processes will &#8220;inherit&#8221; this attribute:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>% setarch i386 -L -R startup_process</pre>
</div>
<p>See the <em>Address Randomization</em> section above.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Holding On Too Long or Letting Go Too Soon</p>
<p>What does <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Shared(client.pool(),</span> <span class="pre">Tab())</span></tt> return?  A proxy
to a Tab in shared memory protected by a process-safe reference count.
Remember, that every copy of the proxy increments the
reference count:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>// Serverside
{
  Val v = Shared(shm, Tab());  // ref count at 1
  pipe.enq(v);                 // ref count at 2
} // Val destructed, ref count at 1


// Clientside
{
  Val off = pipe.deq();  // Ref count at 1
}  // Val destructed, ref count at 0, memory reclaimed</pre>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, once you have enqueued your shared Tab, you can let go
of the packet and let the client dequeue it.  Once the client
dequeues it and is done, it will be reclaimed by the pool.</p>
<p>Be careful not to keep your Tab alive after you have enqueued it,
or that could become a memory growth.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>With three simple abstractions, tables across shared memory

<h3>Known Bugs:<a class="headerlink" href="#known-bugs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are still some known bugs: we prefer to release early so as to

<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">int_un</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">int_n</span></tt> DO NOT work with shared memory.
A future version will fix this.  <strong>FIXED: in PicklingTools 1.4.1</strong></li>
<li>Should a Val initialized from a Proxy copy the allocator?
This makes the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">IsSHM</span></tt> check without an explicit work-around
