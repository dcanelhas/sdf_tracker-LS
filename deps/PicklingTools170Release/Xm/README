This directory contains a tar/gziped X-Midas Option Tree showing how
to build sample C++ primitives using the MidasTalker and MidasServer.
All of the files in the tarball are copies of the files from this
distribution elsewhere, but copied again in the tarball so it's easy
to untar and install as an X-Midas Option tree.

The basic build should be straight-forward:

# Requires X-Midas 4.2.0 or later

  # Csh commands
  % cd <dir>
  % cp -r PicklingTools170/Xm/ptools170 .

  ! X-Midas command inside of X-Midas shell
  > xmopt ptools /new/all/lower/case/path/ptools170
  > xmp +ptools
  > xmbopt ptools

This builds and creates a ptools option tree with a bunch of
primitives: xmserver, xmclient, permclient, permserver are some
examples.  Take a look at the primitives.cfg, commands.cfg and
libraries.cfg to see how we built everything.

Again, all the files in the inc and lib directories are copies of
files from the rest of the distribution (in particular, the inc/oc is
(mostly) just a copy of the
   PicklingTools170/C++/opencontainers_1_8_5/include
directory).


NEW!!! If you wish to deliver a namespaced option tree, we suggest you
change the name to nsptools170 because when namespaces are in place, ptools
compiles and links very differently (and in fact will not work as expected
with old code).  You shouldn't HAVE to do this: the default configuration
still namespaces everything and opens up the namespace, so all the link
symbols are protected.  If you HAVE to make a version with strict 
namespacing, follow the rules below:

To deliver a namespaced option tree:

  # Csh commands
  % cd <dir>
  % cp -r PicklingTools170/Xm/ptools170 ./nsptools170    ## NOTICE NAME CHANGE!!
  
      EDIT nsptools170/inc/ocport.h and uncomment the line with:
       //  #define OC_FORCE_NAMESPACE
      By defining OC_FORCE_NAMESPACE, you force the user to deal the 
      OC namespace without a default 'using'

      EDIT nsptools170/cfg/commands.cfg and change PTOOLS to NSPTOOLS
      EDIT all your .cfg files in your option trees and change 
         libdepend + *;ptools 
             to
         libdepend + *;nsptools 
     
  ! X-Midas command inside of X-Midas shell
  > xmopt nsptools /new/all/lower/case/path/nsptools170
  > xmp +nsptools
  > xmbopt nsptools
