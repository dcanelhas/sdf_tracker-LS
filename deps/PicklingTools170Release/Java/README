The Java support is still in its infancy, but it has been working for us.
What's here:

   com/picklingtools/pythonesque:
 -----------------------------------
   pythonesque:  Java package: Java code for data structures in Java 
                 (Tab, Arr, PTools) that give us Python-like access in Java. 
                 This Java package allows reading and writing textual Python 
                 dicts and lists
                 (to files and strings).


   com/picklingtools/pickle:
 -----------------------------------
   pickle:       Java package: Basically lifted from the pyro-lite distribution
                 with a few bug fixes.  This would work with Python 2.6 and 
                 Python 2.7.  THIS IS THE DIR YOU SHOULD BE USING 
                 (not the pyrolite).

   com/picklingtools/midas:
 -----------------------------------
   midas:        Java package: implementing the Socket reader (MidasTalker).
                 Some good example code in MidasTalker_ex.java and 
                 MidasTalker_ex2.java.




   pyrolite:     Open Source distribution, included ONLY FOR INFORMATIONAL
                 PURPOSES, as you should be using the pickle dir (above)


   Makefile:     command-line Java for building MidasTalker_ex and 
                 MidasTalker_ex2.  



You'll probably just want to import the three packages: pythonesque, pickle,
and midas into your Java appropriately.

There is some documentation in the Docs area. 


EXAMPLE:

The MidasTalker_ex.java and MidasTalker_ex2.java in the com/picklingtools/midas
directories show two examples of how to use the MidasTalker.  The first one
is the more "simplified" version, which shows a few ways to interact with
Tab, Arr, and Object within Java. The example2 shows how to deal
with timeouts on recvs, timeouts on connects, and problems connecting.

To try out:

  Over on some host, run a midasserver.
  
   % cd PicklingTools150/Python
   % python midasserver_ex.py --ser=2 --sock=2 --arrdisp=2 --server_send_message_at_connect=0 localhost 8888


  Over on you client, build the MidasTalker_ex or MidasTalker_ex2
  (You may need to edit the Makefiles to change JAVAPLACE to be the top-level)
  % cd PicklingTools/150/Java
  % make midastalker_ex2
  % java -cp "/home/rts/Pickling/PicklingTools150/Java" com.picklingtools.midas.MidasTalker_ex2 localhost 8888 2 1 2

    ... make sure your SocketDuplex is reported as DUAL_SOCKET ...


This should give you some confidence that you can send messages back and
forth between Python and Java (sim. for C++).  Note that --ser=2, --sock=2 
and --arrdisp=2:  unfortunately, the PicklingTools library is not as
full featured (yet) as the C++ one, so we only support serialization 2,
dualsocket and array disposition of AS_LIST (--arrdisp=1) and AS_PYTHON_ARRAY 
(--arrdisp=2).
